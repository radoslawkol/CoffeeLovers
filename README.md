## Story

This is my first serious React project. I'm happy to finish it. I came across different problems connecting with styling and react logic.
The most difficult part of website was creating Testimonials.js. I struggled with making working abd responsive carousel.

Thanks to this project I practiced the basis of React: useState, useEffect, Context API, Portals and react-router(v6).
I also refreshed some SCSS knowledge.

I'm happy with final effect. I hope you like it :)
