## Story

During my journey with my first serious React project, I encountered various challenges related to styling and React logic. 
However, these obstacles allowed me to strengthen my skills and gain valuable experience.

One of the most demanding tasks was creating a responsive testimonials carousel. To enhance my proficiency in React, I decided to tackle this challenge without relying on additional packages. 
It allowed me to dive deeper into React's core features and explore the functionalities

Throughout the development process, I also had the opportunity to refresh and expand my knowledge of SCSS, enabling me to create visually appealing styles for the website.
This project has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to apply fundamental React concepts and explore various aspects of web development.
